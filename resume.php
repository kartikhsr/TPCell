            <li> <big><strong><em>Keep it Recent, Keep it Relevant: </em></strong></big><small>As
                a rule, you should only show the most recent 10-15 years of your
                career history and only include the experience relevant to the
                positions to which you are applying. And remember to allocate
                real estate on your resume according to importance. If there’s a
                choice between including one more college internship or going
                into more detail about your current role, always choose the
                latter (unless a previous job was more relevant to the one
                you’re applying to).</small> </li>
            <li> <big><strong><em>Keep it Simple: </em></strong></big><small>We’ll
                talk about getting creative in order to stand out in a minute.
                But the most basic principle of good resume formatting and
                design? Keep it simple. Use a basic but modern font, like
                Helvetica, Arial, or Century Gothic. Make your resume easy on
                hiring managers’ eyes by using a font size between 10 and 12 and
                leaving a healthy amount of white space on the page. You can use
                a different font or typeface for your name, your resume headers,
                and the companies for which you’ve worked, but keep it simple
                and keep it consistent. Your main focus here should be on
                readability for the hiring manager.</small> </li>
            <li> <big><strong><em>Keep it to a Page: </em></strong> </big><small>The
                two-(or more!) page resume is a hotly debated topic ,but the
                bottom line is this—you want the information here to be concise,
                and making yourself keep it to one page is a good way to force
                yourself to do this. If you truly have enough relevant and
                important experience, training, and credentials to showcase on
                more than one page of your resume, then go for it. But if you
                can tell the same story in less space. Then make only one page.</small>
            </li>
            <li> <big><strong><em>Don’t Put Everything on There: </em></strong></big><small>Your
                resume should not have every work experience you’ve ever had
                listed on it. Think of your resume not as a comprehensive list
                of your career history, but as a marketing document selling you
                as the perfect person for the job. For each resume you send out,
                you’ll want to highlight only the accomplishments and skills
                that are most relevant to the job at hand (even if that means
                you don’t include all of your experience).</small> </li>
            <li> <big><strong><em>Make Your Contact Info Prominent: </em></strong></big><small>You
                don’t need to include your address on your resume anymore
                (really!), but you do need to make sure to include a phone
                number and professional email address (not your work address!)
                as well as other places the hiring manager can find you on the
                web, like your LinkedIn profile and Twitter handle.</small> </li>
            <li> <big><strong><em>Get Help From a Professional: </em></strong></big><small>Know
                that design skills aren’t your strong suit but want your resume
                to look stunning? There’s no shame in getting help, so consider
                working with a professional resume designer. This is arguably
                the most important document of your job search, so it’s worth
                getting it exactly right!.</small> </li>
            <li> <big><strong><em>Avoid Empty Words: </em></strong></big><small>What
                words shouldn’t you include? Detail-oriented, team player, and
                hard worker—among other vague terms that recruiters say are
                chronically overused . We bet there’s a better way to describe
                how awesome you are.</small> </li>
            <li> <big><strong><em>Experience First, Education Second: </em></strong></big><small>Unless
                you’re a recent graduate, put your education after your
                experience. Chances are, your last couple of jobs are more
                important and relevant to you getting the job than where you
                went to college.</small> </li>
            <li> <big><strong><em>List Out Your Skills: </em></strong></big><small>Be
                sure to add a section that lists out all the relevant skills you
                have for a position, including tech skills like HTML and Adobe
                Creative Suite and any industry-related certifications. Just
                make sure to skip including skills that everyone is expected to
                have, like using email or Microsoft Word. Doing so will actually
                make you seem less technologically savvy.</small> </li>
            <li> <big><strong><em>Show—Don’t Tell—Your Soft Skills: </em></strong></big><small>Describing
                soft skills on a resume often starts to sound like a list of
                meaningless buzzwords, fast. But being a “strong leader” or an
                “effective communicator” are important characteristics you want
                to get across. Think about how you can demonstrate these
                attributes in your bullet points without actually saying them.</small>
